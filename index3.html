        <i style="font-size:150%">Amongst many inventors throughout the history of science, one of the most prominent
            inventors was Nikola
            Tesla. Nikola Tesla was an inventor,<br> an electrical engineer and a mechanical engineer. Nikola Tesla was
            also a Serbian-American Engineer who was highly regarded for his achievements in energy for the advancement
            and growth of Alternating Current (AC) in electrical systems. He also provided his extraordinary
            contributions to electromagnetism and wireless radio communications.</i><br>

            Nikola Tesla (/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə; Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла,[2] pronounced [nǐkola têsla];[a] 10 July
            [O.S. 28 June] 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American[5][6][7] inventor, electrical engineer,
            mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating
            current (AC) electricity supply system.[8]

            Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving
            a degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in
            the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized
            citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his
            own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in
            New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction
            motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable
            amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.
            Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with
            mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a
            wirelessly controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and
            demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his
            showmanship at public lectures.
